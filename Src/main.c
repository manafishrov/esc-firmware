// commutation_interval is used by the back-EMF current limiter to estimate the
// motor's speed fraction relative to theoretical free-spin and cap duty so that
// estimated motor current never exceeds the ESC's rated limit, regardless of BMS.
// stall_ci_threshold is recomputed every main-loop tick as STALL_SPEED_FRACTION
// times the theoretical free-spin commutation interval at current throttle,
// voltage, Kv and pole count. ci_free = stall_ci_threshold/STALL_SPEED_FRACTION
// is the free-spin CI; the limiter scales duty between throttle_max_at_low_rpm

// opening the cap and dumping a high-duty current spike into a stalled motor.

// Pre-sync (< RPM_CONFIRM_ZERO_CROSSES) nominal duty ceiling. During the unsynced
// startup window the back-EMF cap is not yet active, so this is the sole current bound;
// 300/2000 = 15% => worst-case stall current 0.15*20/0.05 = 60A. Kept as its own constant
// rather than reusing throttle_max_at_low_rpm, because the stock firmware inflates that by
// dead_time_override (up to +200 counts) for the low-RPM-limit feature, which would push
// the pre-sync ceiling to ~25% nominal. Capping NOMINAL duty here guarantees effective

// accel torque) and it falsely flags hard *deceleration* as an impossible overspeed (the motor is still
// fast while the commanded free-spin has just dropped). We keep an EMA of the

// whether we are accelerating (gap > 0) or decelerating (gap < 0).
//   - Accel: raise the cap's current limit by the gap, bounded to a burst ceiling.
//     The gap (and thus the boost) decays as the EMA catches up, so a motor that does
//     NOT actually speed up (jammed) drops back to the steady floor within ~tens of ms -
//     transient overcurrent is allowed, sustained overcurrent is not.

// up more, until the load can't sustain it and it collapses back - an RPM limit cycle
// when the motor is loaded past the limit. Rate-limit the cap's OPENING (slow release,
// ~0.4s) to damp this, while keeping instant tightening (fast attack) so current

// --- Motor resistance estimate and the current-derived duty limits ---
// The duty caps here are voltage headroom, not current: duty D above the motor's
// back-EMF drives I = D*Vbat/R through the winding, so a fixed duty only means a fixed
// current for one particular motor and battery voltage. There is no usable current
// sensor (the AM60's shunt reads the sum of all four ESCs), so the current is derived
// from the motor's line-to-line resistance and the measured battery voltage.
//
// R is estimated from the configured Kv rather than measured. For a given motor frame,
// the number of winding turns N scales as 1/Kv and each turn's wire cross-section as
// 1/N (the slot copper area is fixed), so R ~ N^2 ~ 1/Kv^2:
//     R(Kv) = MOTOR_R_REF_MILLIOHM * (MOTOR_KV_REF / Kv)^2
// anchored on a measured Manafish thruster motor (930 KV -> 180 mOhm line-to-line).
// This holds for motors of similar size and construction to the reference; a much
// larger or smaller frame at the same Kv will deviate, so it is an estimate and does
// not replace measuring. It deliberately models the winding only - ESC FETs, wiring and
// connectors add series resistance, which makes the real current LOWER than the target,
// so that error is on the safe side.

#define MOTOR_R_MIN_MILLIOHM      20  // clamps keep an extreme Kv setting from producing nonsense
#define MOTOR_R_MAX_MILLIOHM    2000

// Lower bound on the derived floor: keeps enough headroom to start and hold a motor if
// the resistance estimate comes out very small. There is deliberately no upper bound
// below full duty: when the target current needs more than 100% duty (high-resistance
// motor or low battery voltage), the motor cannot reach the target even stalled at full
// duty, so the floor saturates at 2000 and the cap simply never binds. This relies on
// the resistance estimate being accurate - only motors of the reference form factor are
// used, so R ~ 1/Kv^2 holds.
#define BEMF_CAP_FLOOR_MIN       100  // 5% duty
